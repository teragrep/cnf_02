= Teragrep Configuration Wrapper for Typesafe Config

// Add a short description of your project. Tell what your project does and what it's used for.

CNF-02 is a library that provides immutable configuration for Typesafe Config for projects using Java. Typesafe Config will be converted to https://github.com/teragrep/cnf_01[CNF-01]'s Configuration interface, so it is wise to read through its documentation as well. CNF-02 has CNF-01 as a dependency, so it provides all the functionality that it has.

The goal is to have CNF-02 as an extension of CNF-01 with the added third party dependency of Typesafe Config. This ensures that if a project does not use Typesafe for configuration, it doesn't have to be added as a dependency when migrating to use the CNF-01 library.

== Features

// List your project's features
- Converts Typesafe Config to CNF-01 interface.
- Provides all functionalities from CNF-01 with a transitive dependency to the component.

== Limitations

CNF-01's interface converts to a String to String map of configurations. For this reason, Lists used in Typesafe Config are represented as Strings. The resulting List Strings are in Json format and can be parsed with Jakarta or Gson for example.

Maps are represented individually as key-value pairs like in Typesafe Config.

Null values are not supported. Keys that have null values are not present in the resulting Map.

== How to Implement

See https://github.com/teragrep/cnf_01[CNF-01's documentation] for instructions on implementation.

== How to Use

// add instructions how people can start to use your project
See https://github.com/teragrep/cnf_01[CNF-01's documentation] for using the library.

Example for using `TypesafeConfiguration`:

[,java]
----
// One way of initializing Typesafe Config
Config config = ConfigFactory.parseFile("file/path");

// Converting Config to CNF-01 Map.
Configuration configuration = new TypesafeConfiguration(config);
Map<String, String> configurationMap = configuration.asMap();
----
